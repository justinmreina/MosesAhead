Thanks dude we should start a computer flipping business😂
Ok
Wait
If you try to sell someone Espoir’s and they catch on
They may get pissed! 😳
Everything would be in their eyes tho
Ok yes
Can convince your grandmother to buy it, because she loves you
Don’t use my name tho! 😝
She doesn’t need one but it would be simple I’ll find a laptop send u the info u tell me if it’s good or bad if it’s good u do the fun stuff to it maybe get a bag for it then sell it for more Nd then we both get paid😂
This sounds interesting, would be fun and a great chance for you to learn
But this realm of business is filled with crooks! Treacherous waters, stay out
Every realm of business is a he same
Yes
This is a hotspot today though
With very little returns too, which is a bit ironic
Explain
A lot of average class, middle-aged men see this as easy returns
A pretty common topic of pursuit for early 20’a
And a low-investment high returns market for the established com-artist
With each finding leisure, and indulgence in said activities
😩
So ur saying it’s a scam
For the con-artists yes!!
For the others, a mixed bag
What’s a mixed bag
That’s an analogy for a set of things that are very different, the highs and the lows
The good and the bad, all converging together in the same set, or “bag”
So not a good investment
No
I have my thoughts wrt to investment for you now, let me know
Ok what is it
Cool
Let’s start with the foundation, framework and targets
I will ask some questions, and take some notes
For your foundation, what are you good at?
On investment?
Stop using that word for the moment, it bears bias and predisposition
In life - the sciences, arts; business; philosophy? Outreach? Studies? Church... what is Moses good with today?
For me it is the sciences, outreach and embedded software, to note
I can easily socialize with people I learn almost anything fast and like to add creativity or swag to everything
Dude
Cool! This is what I was thinking
For your immediate network, and family, what resources or people have similar interest or skill?
Idk
Indulge me
Are there any business folk you are related to?
Smart cookies?
Cunning Biz minds?
Oh -
Art!!
do you know anyone else like him?
We can put Mami in the ‘Academic’ corner
Ok eapoir has a degree In Mechatronics Peter studying electrician my friends uncle works in Microsoft and this guy called Justin Ik is a computer addict
And Esther in the ‘ Ambition for Excellence’ corner
Yes she’s gonna be a pilot
Justin for engineering
Any others, like these? Thoughts?
Ok eapoir has a degree In Mechatronics Peter studying electrician my friends uncle works in Microsoft and this guy called Justin Ik is a computer addict
Everybody I can think for now is in here I think
Cool, Team:
• Art, Mami, Esther, Espoir, Peter, Jik & Jmr
Yes
Last for foundation, do you have any affiliations or interested in current fields of work?
Cinematography or video editing, for example
Don’t be shy, let me know your thoughts
Idk yet but put it down as that
Those were my thoughts, just checking
I am feeling a flow to this; I think you’ll like where this goes
For framework, what tools or resource do you have to prepare this intellect you describe? To focus the ambition, to channel that desire?
Rich tools with a wide-open canvas right now, important to put them at good use!
🤔
e.g. software, routine, methods, teachers, etc.
The Yoga can be a principal tool now, to note
Ok the yoga nice
Software - Trello, Dropbox, Skype & MATLAB
Any mentors? Academic counselors?
Guides?
Nope
We can work on that, this is principal
Few more questions
What directions do you have to step forward onto, towards what’s next?
Like community college, internships, outreach; thoughts?
That’s part idk yet
Cool
And now a wide question, searching for passions or direct targets, for the desire and reason
Who do you want to be?
I have too many passions
I wanna be a lot of things
But
You are a finite resource the thinner you spread, the less you achieve
Which you only find out, on results, as I’ve seen
🤔
That’s true so I have to narrow it down the rest can be hobbies
Let’s take this as a moment of practice, in preparation & form
That’s retire the word ‘hobby’, from your vocabulary for the moment - these are now “personal interests”
thoughts?
*Lets retire
Ok done
For your personal interest, let’s explore a little bit
Just in general interest
What are the most exciting?
YouTube sports and building rc cars
What are the highest investment for you? Money, time, efforts, etc.
For now it’s gonna be YouTube and engineering I might become the next tony stark
Explain on the Tony stark
I’m curious
I’m interested in the type of engineering where u build things
To create
Yes!
Why?
It’s fun smart and rewarding
Rewarding; yes
For me, ‘to contribute’
To what?
What do u mean
For me, to contribute
One sec let me pull that up
From a recent professional letter -
“I am led with a passion, a desire & intrigue for the needs around me that holds well for this role; a connection and attention that has delivered consistent results. To what, though? Well personally in ministries & food outreach; academically in engineering leadership & ideation; and professionally, in new high-volume product creation & delivery to market. “To contribute”, in my words, an established asset today ready for your use”
To contribute
How would you describe thy why for the ‘smarts’, for you?
Yea I like helping people providing a better life for me and those around me
I love this
Articulate and clean, well spoken
Ok, last question and then I will share my thoughts
For the target of your next steps, professionally and personally, their may be different viewpoints. Let’s consider this question from the following viewpoints -
  A. Your academic counselor
  B. Your pastor 
  C. Your parents
  D. Me (at least as you’d estimate)
And the most important -
  E. You!
Take your time, share responses individually for each view A-E (no hurries, prep and thought very valuable here)
The diversity to lenses A-E promotes a rich culmination on response, to note
What’s the question tho
Q: What are the targets of Moses' next steps right now? Where does this go?
I don’t really give much thoughts bout other ppl view points to my future idk it’s kind of a complicated
Question
yep!
this is specific method to unravel that, a step
the Lord doesn't "give" sin or evil, he "leaves" it be free - it is from this gift, or diversity to being that the true "nature" to the gift of life begins
same thing here, with all lenses combined
you get a glimpse, a perspective ahead
imo
so give me your best efforts,
A.
B.
C.
D.
E.
have at it! Take your time, this is an established effort I can help let me know \
A. I don’t have an academic counselor 
B.I don’t talk to my pastor but he would want me to do more services in the church probably 
C. My parents see me goin to a good college studying for x years hoping to make x mount of money when I’m done 
D. I’d estimate u want me to be careful choosing what I wanna do 
E. I see myself doin something I like but also a good income source and I see myself developing consistency and discipline
Nice
Thank you for the elaboration and detail! In touch in a bit
Ok
Have you ever heard of GitHub?
No
Interesting
what are your general interests in software or engineering?
I’m into like AI stuff

Intel® Software Innovator David Ojika: Bringing AI to More People
software.intel.com
let me know - lol 😝
I’m doin something rn I’ll look at this later
don't speak in certainties ("I'm doing"), speak in direction
*permission to swear in exclamation, periodically?
Go heat
Ahead
thx
ok so you have no fucking idea "what" you will be doing
"who" you will fall in love with
"where" you'll be going, etc. That's none of our business either, imo; what is our business is direction, focus & alignment on the path ahead
so -
for "AI" for you now, what benefits does this have for your academic path? work path? what benefits can it bring to the work around you?
as you see it now, at least, thoughts?
lol - oops! I misread I thought you were saying "AI is something that I will use later"... you just said u were busy
oops! Nevertheless these are interesting questions, share a resp l8r
