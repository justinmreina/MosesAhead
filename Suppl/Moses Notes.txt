@section 	Procedure
	
	//Moses
	Thanks dude we should start a computer flipping businessüòÇ

	//Justin
	Ok
	Wait
	If you try to sell someone Espoir‚Äôs and they catch on
	They may get pissed! üò≥
	
	//Moses
	Everything would be in their eyes tho
	
	//Justin
	Ok yes
	Can convince your grandmother to buy it, because she loves you
	Don‚Äôt use my name tho! üòù
	
	//Moses
	She doesn‚Äôt need one but it would be simple I‚Äôll find a laptop send u the info u tell me if it‚Äôs good or bad if it‚Äôs good u do the fun stuff to it maybe get a bag for it then sell it for more Nd then we both get paidüòÇ
	
	//Justin
	This sounds interesting, would be fun and a great chance for you to learn
	But this realm of business is filled with crooks! Treacherous waters, stay out
	
	//Moses
	Every realm of business is a he same
	
	//Justin
	Yes
	This is a hotspot today though
	With very little returns too, which is a bit ironic
	
	//Moses
	Explain
	
	//Justin
	A lot of average class, middle-aged men see this as easy returns
	A pretty common topic of pursuit for early 20‚Äôa
	And a low-investment high returns market for the established com-artist
	With each finding leisure, and indulgence in said activities
	üò©
	
	//Moses
	So ur saying it‚Äôs a scam
	
	//Justin
	For the con-artists yes!!
	For the others, a mixed bag
	
	//Moses
	What‚Äôs a mixed bag
	
	//Justin
	That‚Äôs an analogy for a set of things that are very different, the highs and the lows
	The good and the bad, all converging together in the same set, or ‚Äúbag‚Äù
	
	//Moses
	So not a good investment

	//Justin
	No
	I have my thoughts wrt to investment for you now, let me know

	//Moses	
	Ok what is it
	
	//Justin
	Cool
	Let‚Äôs start with the foundation, framework and targets
	I will ask some questions, and take some notes
	For your foundation, what are you good at?

	//Moses
	On investment?

	//Justin
	Stop using that word for the moment, it bears bias and predisposition
	In life - the sciences, arts; business; philosophy? Outreach? Studies? Church... what is Moses good with today?
	For me it is the sciences, outreach and embedded software, to note

	//Moses
	I can easily socialize with people I learn almost anything fast and like to add creativity or swag to everything

	//Justin
	Dude
	Cool! This is what I was thinking
	For your immediate network, and family, what resources or people have similar interest or skill?
	
	//Moses
	Idk

	//Justin
	Indulge me
	Are there any business folk you are related to?
	Smart cookies?
	Cunning Biz minds?
	Oh -
	Art!!
	do you know anyone else like him?
	We can put Mami in the ‚ÄòAcademic‚Äô corner

	//Moses
	Ok espoir has a degree In Mechatronics Peter studying electrician my friends uncle works in Microsoft and this guy called Justin Ik is a computer addict

	//Justin
	And Esther in the ‚ÄòAmbition for Excellence‚Äô corner
	
	//Moses
	Yes she‚Äôs gonna be a pilot

	//Justin
	Justin for engineering
	Any others, like these? Thoughts?

	//Moses
	Ok espoir has a degree In Mechatronics Peter studying electrician my friends uncle works in Microsoft and this guy called Justin Ik is a computer addict
	Everybody I can think for now is in here I think

	//Justin
	Cool, Team:
	‚Ä¢ Art, Mami, Esther, Espoir, Peter, Jik & Jmr

	//Moses
	Yes

	//Justin
	Last for foundation, do you have any affiliations or interested in current fields of work?
	Cinematography or video editing, for example
	Don‚Äôt be shy, let me know your thoughts

	//Moses
	Idk yet but put it down as that

	//Justin
	Those were my thoughts, just checking
	I am feeling a flow to this; I think you‚Äôll like where this goes
	For framework, what tools or resource do you have to prepare this intellect you describe? To focus the ambition, to channel that desire?
	Rich tools with a wide-open canvas right now, important to put them at good use!
	ü§î
	e.g. software, routine, methods, teachers, etc.
	The Yoga can be a principal tool now, to note

	//Moses
	Ok the yoga nice

	//Justin
	Software - Trello, Dropbox, Skype & MATLAB
	Any mentors? Academic counselors?
	Guides?

	//Moses
	Nope

	//Justin
	We can work on that, this is principal
	Few more questions
	What directions do you have to step forward onto, towards what‚Äôs next?
	Like community college, internships, outreach; thoughts?

	//Moses
	That‚Äôs part idk yet

	//Justin
	Cool
	And now a wide question, searching for passions or direct targets, for the desire and reason
	Who do you want to be?

	//Moses
	I have too many passions
	I wanna be a lot of things

	//Justin
	But
	You are a finite resource the thinner you spread, the less you achieve
	Which you only find out, on results, as I‚Äôve seen
	ü§î
	
	//Moses
	That‚Äôs true so I have to narrow it down the rest can be hobbies

	//Justin
	Let‚Äôs take this as a moment of practice, in preparation & form
	That‚Äôs retire the word ‚Äòhobby‚Äô, from your vocabulary for the moment - these are now ‚Äúpersonal interests‚Äù
	thoughts?
	*Lets retire

	//Moses
	Ok done

	//Justin
	For your personal interest, let‚Äôs explore a little bit
	Just in general interest
	What are the most exciting?

	//Moses
	YouTube sports and building rc cars

	//Justin
	What are the highest investment for you? Money, time, efforts, etc.

	//Moses
	For now it‚Äôs gonna be YouTube and engineering I might become the next tony stark

	//Justin
	Explain on the Tony stark
	I‚Äôm curious
	
	//Moses
	I‚Äôm interested in the type of engineering where u build things

	//Justin
	To create
	Yes!
	Why?

	//Moses
	It‚Äôs fun smart and rewarding

	//Justin
	Rewarding; yes
	For me, ‚Äòto contribute‚Äô
	To what?

	//Moses
	What do u mean

	//Justin
	For me, to contribute
	One sec let me pull that up
	From a recent professional letter -
	‚ÄúI am led with a passion, a desire & intrigue for the needs around me that holds well for this role; a connection and attention that has delivered consistent results. To what, though? Well personally in ministries & food outreach; academically in engineering leadership & ideation; and professionally, in new high-volume product creation & delivery to market. ‚ÄúTo contribute‚Äù, in my words, an established asset today ready for your use‚Äù
	To contribute
	How would you describe thy why for the ‚Äòsmarts‚Äô, for you?
	
	//Moses
	Yea I like helping people providing a better life for me and those around me
	
	//Justin
	I love this
	Articulate and clean, well spoken
	Ok, last question and then I will share my thoughts
	For the target of your next steps, professionally and personally, their may be different viewpoints. Let‚Äôs consider this question from the following viewpoints -
	  A. Your academic counselor
	  B. Your pastor 
	  C. Your parents
	  D. Me (at least as you‚Äôd estimate)
	And the most important -
	  E. You!
	Take your time, share responses individually for each view A-E (no hurries, prep and thought very valuable here)
	The diversity to lenses A-E promotes a rich culmination on response, to note
	
	//Moses
	What‚Äôs the question tho
	
	//Justin
	Q: What are the targets of Moses' next steps right now? Where does this go?
	
	//Moses
	I don‚Äôt really give much thoughts bout other ppl view points to my future idk it‚Äôs kind of a complicated
	Question
	
	//Justin
	yep!
	this is specific method to unravel that, a step
	the Lord doesn't "give" sin or evil, he "leaves" it be free - it is from this gift, or diversity to being that the true "nature" to the gift of life begins
	same thing here, with all lenses combined
	you get a glimpse, a perspective ahead
	imo
	so give me your best efforts,
	A.
	B.
	C.
	D.
	E.
	have at it! Take your time, this is an established effort I can help let me know \
	
	//Moses
	A. I don‚Äôt have an academic counselor 
	B.I don‚Äôt talk to my pastor but he would want me to do more services in the church probably 
	C. My parents see me goin to a good college studying for x years hoping to make x mount of money when I‚Äôm done 
	D. I‚Äôd estimate u want me to be careful choosing what I wanna do 
	E. I see myself doin something I like but also a good income source and I see myself developing consistency and discipline
	
	//Justin
	Nice
	Thank you for the elaboration and detail! In touch in a bit
	
	//Moses
	Ok
	
	//Justin
	Have you ever heard of GitHub?

	//Moses
	No

	//Justin
	Interesting
	what are your general interests in software or engineering?

	//Moses
	I‚Äôm into like AI stuff
	
	//Justin
	Careful -

	Intel Software Innovator David Ojika: Bringing AI to More People
	software.intel.com
	let me know - lol üòù
	I‚Äôm doin something rn I‚Äôll look at this later
	don't speak in certainties ("I'm doing"), speak in direction
	*permission to swear in exclamation, periodically?
	Go heat
	Ahead
	thx
	ok so you have no fucking idea "what" you will be doing
	"who" you will fall in love with
	"where" you'll be going, etc. That's none of our business either, imo; what is our business is direction, focus & alignment on the path ahead
	so -
	for "AI" for you now, what benefits does this have for your academic path? work path? what benefits can it bring to the work around you?
	as you see it now, at least, thoughts?
	lol - oops! I misread I thought you were saying "AI is something that I will use later"... you just said u were busy
	oops! Nevertheless these are interesting questions, share a resp l8r
